Project Title: BeerTinder

Developers: Adam Kojak, Bill King, James Jannetti

Project Description:
BeerTinder is an app that connects the user to their ideal beer.  User will receive a shitload of random images of beer, one by one, with a brief description and tasting notes about that beer. The user will decide to “swipe” right or left if they think the beer is good. If the user swipes right = “good” then the user will be prompt of where the location of the beer is and cost.  The swiped right beers will be saved in the users profile. Users will also be able to search to for beer.
